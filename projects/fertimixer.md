## Project Overview
As part of our **Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)** at WPI, our team collaborated with **NESS Fertigation** to improve their existing fertilizer mixing system. We designed and built a **solar-powered, fully automated dual-tank fertigation prototype** that increases scalability, reduces environmental impact, and minimizes operator input.  

The project was carried out remotely at **Venice, Italy**, in partnership with NESS Fertigation. Our final deliverables included a **working prototype**, a **design/userâ€™s manual** for reproducibility, and a **Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM)** to evaluate environmental benefits.

## Technical Contributions
- **Microcontroller System:** Developed using an **Arduino Nano ESP32-S3** and programmed in **C++**, with fault detection, deep sleep modes, and communication with SolTag controllers.
- **Valve Control:** Designed a dual-tank switching mechanism with **six solenoid valves** managed via **L298N motor drivers**, ensuring continuous operation by alternating filling and emptying cycles.
- **Sensors & Monitoring:** Integrated float sensors for tank level detection and implemented error reporting over analog signals for system reliability.
- **Power System:** Sized and tested a **solar panel system** to meet daily energy demand (~44 Wh/day), confirming that a single 30W panel could power the prototype.
- **Housing:** Designed and prototyped a weather-resistant, ventilated enclosure in **SolidWorks**, balancing passive cooling with protection against desert heat and rainfall.

## Environmental Impact
We conducted a **Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM)** comparing our design against conventional fertilizer systems. Results showed:  
- Reduced fertilizer runoff and eutrophication risk.  
- Lower COâ‚‚ emissions by using **solar energy** instead of diesel generators.  
- Improved scalability and ease of adoption in remote, resource-limited communities.
