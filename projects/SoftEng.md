## Project Overview
As part of **CS3733-D23: Software Engineering**, our team *Overworked Ouroboroi* (Max Berman, Alexander Presser, Allen Cheung, Anuragi Thapliya, Keelan Boyle, Mike McInerney, Nicholas Leslie, Ruba Khan, Sophia Woodward, Stephen Fanning) created a **hospital service request system** for Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital. The application supports map editing, meal and supply delivery, therapy requests, signage management, and **robot-assisted navigation**. It connects to a PostgreSQL database and includes staff/admin login functionality.

I contributed in two main areas:  
- **Robotics Integration** â€“ Programmed a robot to track AprilTags and navigate toward service request locations, allowing the system to dispatch and guide a physical delivery robot:contentReference.  
- **Documentation Analyst** â€“ Led the creation of the **User Manual** and final project documentation, ensuring that system design, usage instructions, and technical details were clearly explained.

## Key Features
- **Service Requests:** Supports requests for meals, office supplies, flowers, therapy animals, and IT services. 
- Implemented error-handling popups for service requests and login failures to improve robustness.   
- **Map Editing & Pathfinding:** Editable hospital maps with pathfinding via A*, BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra algorithms. Visual and text directions grouped by floor improved usability.  
- **Robotics Control:**  
  - Integrated FRC-based robot hardware with RoboRIO, Limelight vision, and AprilTag detection.  
  - Added a **robot control panel** for autonomous navigation and service request fulfillment.  
- **Backend & Cloud:**  
  - PostgreSQL database with DAO and Facade patterns.  
  - Real-time announcements via **AWS Lambda** + **WebSockets**.  
  - OAuth login via AWS Cognito.  
- **Documentation & Testing:** Produced detailed documentation and user instructions, including UML diagrams, ERDs, and user-facing help resources.
