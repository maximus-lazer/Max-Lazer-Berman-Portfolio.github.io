## Project Overview
As part of **HU3910: Musical Robotics**, our team (Curtis Soloff, Max Berman, AJ Berry) created the **Electromagnetic Guitar (EM Guitar)**. The system uses **capacitive touch fret and string sensors**, an **Arduino Uno**, and **six electromagnets driven by MOSFET boards** to generate infinite sustain and enable new styles of guitar performance. Unlike earlier projects or products (e.g., EBow, Sustainiac), our design is **self-contained**, supports **all six strings**, and allows **chords as well as single notes**.

## Design & Implementation
- **Inputs:** Capacitive touch (MPR121 IÂ²C boards) read copper tape frets and per-string pads, allowing flexible detection without bulky switches.  
- **Signal Generation:** The Arduino Uno computes note frequencies from string + fret inputs and outputs square waves using the internal clock. To balance volume, duty cycles varied by string (50% for high strings, 30% for A, 20% for low E).  
- **Electromagnet Drive:** Arduino outputs switch two **Mosfetti 4-channel MOSFET boards**, powering **six Adafruit P20/15 electromagnets** from a 5V USB battery bank. Adjustable 3D-printed mounts and spacers set magnet height.  
- **Audio Output:** Used **piezo pickups** instead of magnetic ones to avoid interference from the drive signals; preamp or pedal recommended for clean amplification.  
- **Power:** Powered entirely by an **Anker PowerCore MetroEssential 20000** USB battery bank, keeping the system portable and self-contained.

## Results
- Achieved **infinite sustain** without string attack, producing a unique, organ-like sound.  
- Supported **simultaneous excitation of multiple strings** with mapped fret/string inputs, enabling chordal play.  
- Fully **portable design**: just plug the Arduino and MOSFET boards into the battery pack.  
- **Challenges:** occasional stuck capacitive sensors, piezo requiring high amplification, and limited dynamic control (volume tied to duty cycle, not real-time).

## Modifications & Extensions
- Expanded to **12 frets of capacitive sensing** via daisy-chained MPR121 boards.  
- Integrated **electronics beneath a custom clear acrylic pickguard**, showcasing the systemâ€™s internals.  
- Code extended to **map multiple frets across multiple strings**, allowing power chords and more complex shapes.  
- Future work: per-string per-fret sensing, pressure-sensitive inputs for dynamic control, and Fourier-based auto-tuning of electromagnet signals.

## Recognition
The EM Guitar was also prepared in **NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) conference format**, demonstrating the projectâ€™s viability as a novel instrument design.
