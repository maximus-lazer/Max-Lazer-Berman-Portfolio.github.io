summary: "Created a self-contained electromagnet-driven guitar that combines traditional play with new methods through capacitance touch sensors and Arduino control."
---

## Project Overview
- Built an **electromagnet-driven guitar** that enables new styles of play while preserving traditional techniques.
- Integrated **capacitance touch sensors** on frets to detect which notes are pressed.
- Programmed an **Arduino UNO** to convert fret input into frequencies that drive electromagnets over the strings.
