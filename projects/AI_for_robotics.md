## Project Overview
- Applied graph search, optimization techniques, and machine learning to robotics problems.
- Designed an AI agent for a Bomberman-style game that could survive at least 50% of runs in multiple scenarios.
- Implemented a hybrid solution combining **A\*** search for pathfinding and a **state machine** for decision-making.
