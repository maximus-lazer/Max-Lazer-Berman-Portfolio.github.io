## Project Overview
- Implemented **SLAM** for mapping and **A\*** for path planning on a Turtlebot3 Burger.
- Applied **Pure Pursuit** for path tracking.
- Used **Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)** for robot positioning.
- Programmed a **4-DoF robotic arm** to sort colored objects using HSV/RGB filtering and inverse kinematics.
