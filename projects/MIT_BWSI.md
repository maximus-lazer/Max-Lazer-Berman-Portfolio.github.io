## Course Context (MIT BWSI — AUVC)

The **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge (AUVC)** at MIT Beaver Works is a four-week, full-time summer course focused on **underwater robotics**. Students learn fundamentals, program in **Python and C++**, and operate **off-the-shelf underwater vehicles**, culminating in a mission-planning final project. Daily schedule includes **pool time, seminar, and classroom** blocks. More details about the curriculum can be found on the [official course website](https://blksail-edu.github.io/).

The course is led by **Dr. Mohamed Saad Ibn Seddik**, who guides students through the fundamentals of autonomy, mission planning, and underwater vehicle operation while emphasizing both software (ROS 2, Python/C++) and hardware integration.

## Project Overview
- Worked as a **teaching assistant** for MIT’s Beaver Works Summer Institute course on AUVs.
- Helped students with **vector math, control theory, and sensor integration**.
- Guided projects using **vision processing, lane detection, and AprilTags** for pool navigation in C++ and Python.
